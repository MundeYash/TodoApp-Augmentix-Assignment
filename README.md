Objective: Create a to-do list application where users can add, edit, and delete
tasks.
â€¢ Details: Use MongoDB to store tasks, Express.js for server-side operations,
React.js for the user interface, and Node.js for backend logic.

This is a simple To-Do List application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The application allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It also includes pagination to manage a large number of tasks, as per the requirements given in the Augmentix assignment.
